### Update 4: 20/04/2021

#### [Entering 32 Bit Protected Mode.](logs/update4.md)

Coming here after 10 days or so, but the time off the tracks was really necessary.

I did a very dire mistake and kept emulating for ```80206``` never actually realisizing that it is only a 16 bit microprocessor.
I was supposed to use ```80306```.

A lot of time and energy rendered useless because I was trying to achieve and run 32 bit instructions on a 16 bit machine.

Not Cool.

So I decided to get off the track and devote time to reading, learning and understanding the structure of the processor.
So that's what I did.

Now, with a little bit of confidence in this I was ready to move ahead.

In the last update I wrote the GDT because I techinically messed it up

It was becoming more and more tedious and had for me to wrap my head around the struture of 80306.
